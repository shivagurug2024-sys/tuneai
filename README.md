Project Overview:
AI Music Composer is a web-based musical application allowing one to design unique musical pieces by selecting a few parameters such as genre, key, mood, tempo, or instruments.

Key Features: 

Clean and simple UI allowing one to fine-tune the style of music and instrument.

Real-time playback using browser audio synthesis for multiple instruments.

AI-based music generation with original melodies according to the input of the user.

Download the compositions as MIDI files to use in other music software.

Responsive and smooth user experience. 

Technology Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tone.js for sound synthesis.

Backend: Node.js server to handle AI music generation and delivery of MIDI files.
